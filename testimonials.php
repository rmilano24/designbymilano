                  <p>Ryan is a rockstar designer and developer who brought tons of energy to the studio. He was brilliant at selling his work to clients which allowed us to be a successful yet nimble team. Over the past 10 years, my studio was the most profitable when Ryan and I were working together.</p>

                  <p>Ryan worked with Aatma on both the design and development of our new website.</p>

                  <p>Being a creative animation company, we are sticklers for high-quality, and Ryan was bang on target.</p>

                  <p>We loved working with him. He has the following strengths according to us: His dual skills of conceptualizing and executing makes him lethal. (By this we mean his design and development skills). Speed and efficiency makes him a joy to work with. He wasted no time in understanding exactly what we wanted, and delivered more than what we expected in super quick turnaround times.</p>
