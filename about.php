                              <p>We loved working with him. He has the following strengths according to us: His dual skills of conceptualizing and executing makes him lethal. (By this we mean his design and development skills). Speed and efficiency makes him a joy to work with. He wasted no time in understanding exactly what we wanted, and delivered more than what we expected in super quick turnaround times.</p>

							<h4>Organization</h4>

							<p>We start with a conversation about organizing all the site’s content areas into a logical flow. This is where we determine each page’s purpose and what the user is meant to do. Once finished, the actual content can be placed by importance and desired user actions. We also review the content publishing needs at this point</p>

							<h4>Moodboards</h4>

							<p>A moodboard is a collection of inspiring elements we bring together for the purpose of directing the website’s look and feel. Color palettes, example typography, textures, and photographic styles are assembled as a reference and design compass. As always, this is a collaborative endeavor and we want your input!</p>

							<h4>UI Design / Wireframing</h4>

							<p>After the content is determined, we begin to start visualizing the layout using a simple block style. Each block is labeled and represents a content area so that we can begin to see the order we established earlier. This allows us to focus on the visual importance and content area size for each element of the page.</p>

							<h4>UX Design</h4>

							<p>Color is often the most intensely personal part of the design process. We save it for the end of the design phase so that it doesn’t impede the progress of the rest of the design process. At this point we also introduce visual styling such as textures, patterns, and depth and lighting simulations.</p>

							<p>The site is now ready for content! We encourage our clients to add the content at this phase as it helps in becoming familiar with the ExpressionEngine CMS. The next step is to ensure that everything works properly and is as expected. Testing every page and feature will turn up issues that need to be addressed before launch.</p>
